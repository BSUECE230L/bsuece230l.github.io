== Introduction

In a previous lab, we designed adder circuitry to sum two numbers
together. These circuits even became so advanced as to be able to chain
effectively indefinitely to sum numbers of arbitrary binary width.

This begs an interesting question… How do we subtract? In this lab, we are
going to work our way to Two’s Compliment to discover why it is so important
and powerful as a concept within computer science.

== Reference Materials

This lab has optional (but recommended) additional reading. If you are having
any trouble please make sure you have read the following first:

* xref:number_theory.adoc[Explanation and Derivation of Ones/Twos Compliment]
* xref:help_on_ones.adoc[Ones Compliment Implementation Help]
* xref:verilog_project_layout.adoc[Help on Verilog Project Layout]

The number theory document walks through engineering the solutions to all of
the required modules below. Use it to augment your class learning to complete
the lab.

=== Half Subtractor

.Half Subtractor Truth Table
[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|A |B |Y |Borrow
|0 |0 |0 |0
|0 |1 |1 |1
|1 |0 |1 |0
|1 |1 |0 |0
|===

IMPORTANT: In the file `half_sub.v`, implement the equations for the
half subtractor truth table above. Use the half adder from previous labs
for inspiration. You can also generate the two input KMaps for each of Y
and Borrow to derive the equations if you would like. Use the following
table for your inputs and outputs in your `top.v`. Run the simulation to
make sure your adder follows the truth table before you proceed.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Signal |Purpose |Direction
|sw[0] |A of subtractor |IN
|sw[1] |B of subtractor |IN
|led[0] |Y of subtractor |OUT
|led[1] |Borrow of subtractor |OUT
|===


=== Ones Compliment

IMPORTANT: In the file `ones_compliment.v` implement a block that
does ones compliment addition between two four bit numbers using the IO
table below:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Signal |Purpose |Direction
|sw[2] |Number A bit 0 |IN
|sw[3] |Number A bit 1 |IN
|sw[4] |Number A bit 2 |IN
|sw[5] |Number A bit 3 |IN
|sw[6] |Number B bit 0 |IN
|sw[7] |Number B bit 1 |IN
|sw[8] |Number B bit 2 |IN
|sw[9] |Number B bit 3 |IN
|led[2] |Ones’ Compliment addition bit 0 |OUT
|led[3] |Ones’ Compliment addition bit 1 |OUT
|led[4] |Ones’ Compliment addition bit 2 |OUT
|led[5] |Ones’ Compliment addition bit 3 |OUT
|===

NOTE: Use the `full_adder.v` from last week.

WARNING: Please read xref:help_on_ones.adoc[this] because there is a wrong way to
do this that will still work. Alternatively, if you have seen this
critical warning in your output and/or have run into the `test.py`
executing forever, you may want to read xref:help_on_ones.adoc[this]:

.Combinatorial loop

=== Twos Compliment

IMPORTANT: Implement a Twos’ Compliment *converter* in the file
`twos_compliment.v` on an 8 bit number using the following IO Table.

WARNING: This is not a Two's Compliment adder, just a converter. It should take
in an 8 bit number and output its Two's Compliment.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Signal |Purpose |Direction
|sw[2] |Number bit 0 |IN
|sw[3] |Number bit 1 |IN
|sw[4] |Number bit 2 |IN
|sw[5] |Number bit 3 |IN
|sw[6] |Number bit 4 |IN
|sw[7] |Number bit 5 |IN
|sw[8] |Number bit 6 |IN
|sw[9] |Number bit 7 |IN
|led[6] |Twos’ Compliment bit 0 |OUT
|led[7] |Twos’ Compliment bit 1 |OUT
|led[8] |Twos’ Compliment bit 2 |OUT
|led[9] |Twos’ Compliment bit 3 |OUT
|led[10] |Twos’ Compliment bit 4 |OUT
|led[11] |Twos’ Compliment bit 5 |OUT
|led[12] |Twos’ Compliment bit 6 |OUT
|led[13] |Twos’ Compliment bit 7 |OUT
|===

NOTE: Use the `full_adder.v` from week 4.

TIP: These are the same eight switches we use for the Ones Compliment adder
above, but that’s fine – they can go to the inputs of more than one
module.
