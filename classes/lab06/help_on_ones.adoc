There are two right ways to implement a circuit like this, but one of
them is a little less right than the others. What on earth do I mean by
this?

When we were investigating the need for the end-around carry/borrow in
the Ones Compliment section, I mentioned

____
end-around problem causes absolute havoc with computer systems and makes
them significantly more slow than they would otherwise be.
____

Now, that’s deliciously vague, but let’s expand on it. When we look at
the following Verilog code, what do we see?

[source,verilog]
----
module full_adder(
    input A, B, Cin,
    output Y, Cout
);
    wire Sum;
    assign Sum = A ^ B;
    assign Y = Sum ^ Cin;
    assign Cout = (Sum & Cin) | (A & B);
    
endmodule

module top(
    input [3:0] sw,
    output [1:0] led
);

    wire carry;

    full_adder lsb(
        .A(sw[0]),
        .B(sw[2]),
        .Y(led[0]),
        .Cout(carry)
    );
    
    full_adder msb(
        .A(sw[1]),
        .B(sw[3]),
        .Y(led[1]),
        .Cin(carry)
    );

endmodule
----

Well, obviously this is an implementation of a two bit adder lifted from
week 4. However, there’s quite a lot more to this than meets the eye.
The `Y` component of `msb` depends on the `carry` signal coming from the
`Cout` signal of `lsb`. That means, to put an extremely long story I
hope to get in to later short, `msb` can’t be stable and know its output
until `lsb` is.

We can make this a *lot* worse, if we end-around carry:

[source,verilog]
----
// full adder omitted for brevity
module top(
    input [3:0] sw,
    output [1:0] led
);

    wire carry;
    wire nuke;

    full_adder lsb(
        .A(sw[0]),
        .B(sw[2]),
        .Y(led[0]),
        .Cin(nuke),
        .Cout(carry)
    );
    
    full_adder msb(
        .A(sw[1]),
        .B(sw[3]),
        .Y(led[1]),
        .Cin(carry),
        .Cout(nuke)
    );

endmodule
----

Well, now we can see that `msb` depends on the output of `lsb` via `carry`. But…
`lsb` depends on `msb` via the `nuke` wire. How is this supposed to resolve? The
Verilog compiler in Vivado is seeing this too and is trying to tell you that you
might have some pain headed your way if the implementations of your logic won’t
ever stabilize. Circuits like this might become what are called _astable
multivibrators_, aka *clocks*. They will just change state until the end of time
when given power.

However, luckily for our case, we know that this infinite loop is
_never_ possible with our adder circuits. Let’s examine the worst case
scenario to prove it out:

[source,txt]
----
 10
+11
==>
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 0, carry out
that carry out loops around:
1 + 1 = 0, carry out
0 + 1 = 1, no carry
loop ends, result is:

10
----

No matter what combination of inputs we use, the carry will eventually
land on a zero and end the chain of pain. However, this looped
combinatorial logic is still an extremely bad habit to get into. So… how
do we break it on situations where we are certain we won’t have an
endless loop? How can we demonstrate to the Verilog synthesis engines
that we know what we are doing?

Well, in this case, we can break things down. Really, we have two
additions happening here. The initial `A + B`, then _if_ there is a
carry overflow from that, we want to do `(A + B) + 1`. Therefore, we can
do the following:

[source,verilog]
----
// full adder omitted for brevity
module top(
    input [3:0] sw,
    output [1:0] led
);

    // Stores the intermediary sum (A + B)
    wire [1:0] APlusB;
    // The carry used for A+B. Will need to scale
    // up in higher order addition
    wire carry;
    // The carr out of A+B
    wire around;
    // The carry used for (A + B) + around
    wire second_carry;

    // First addition
    full_adder lsb_inter(
        .A(sw[0]),
        .B(sw[2]),
        .Y(APlusB[0]),
        .Cin(1'b0), // Fix to zero
        .Cout(carry)
    );
    
    full_adder msb_inter(
        .A(sw[1]),
        .B(sw[3]),
        .Y(APlusB[1]),
        .Cin(carry),
        .Cout(around)
    );

    // Second addition
    full_adder lsb(
        .A(APlusB[0]), // Adding LSB of (A + B)
        .B(1'b0), // We are adding 0, with the optional carry:
        .Y(Y[0]), // This is now the real summation
        .Cin(around), // Fix to zero
        .Cout(second_carry) // We still need to carry to second
        // bit of second addition
    );
    
    full_adder msb(
        .A(APlusB[1]),
        .B(1'b0),
        .Y(Y[1]),
        .Cin(second_carry),
        // no carry out!
    );

endmodule
----

However, now we can see a full _four element long_ chain of dependence
from the first summation all the way out to the final MSB of the second
addition. This, when coupled with the speed of light and gate
delays/logic delays/propagation delays, etc. – this circuit is slow.
