== Structure of Lab

[.column]
[.compact-list]
* Each week, there will be a problem available on the site
* PLEASE read before you come in, it will help
* Demonstrate the working design to your TA/Instructor
* Write lab report, submit with code to Canvas
** Code can be attached as .zip or link to GitHub

[.column]
. 20% for Lab Report
. 50% for code
. 30% for demonstration
. Absolutely no plagarism or AI

[.columns]
== What we will be doing

[.column]
. Digital Design
. Verilog Hardware Description Language
. Hands on with RTL Engineering

. Basics: AND/OR/NOR...
. Intermediate: Logic equations and minimization

[.columns]
== Verilog HDL

[.column]
* Verilog is *not* a programming language
* You are describing a physical circuit
* There is no "execution" or "order"

=== Resulting Circuit

There is no "clock", no execution, no assignment -- the FPGA will physically conect that button to that LED.
