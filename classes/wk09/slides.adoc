[.columns]
== Continuous Assignment

[.column]
* Continuous assignment always happens
* Cannot "wait" for an event
* Cannot "remember" the past

[.columns]
== Synchronous Logic

[.column]
* Happens on certain events
* Signals the output is _synchronous_ to
* Contains memory

[.columns]
== The SR-Latch

[.column]
* Basic form of memory
* Uses combinatorial loops
* Should be implemented using behavioral verilog
